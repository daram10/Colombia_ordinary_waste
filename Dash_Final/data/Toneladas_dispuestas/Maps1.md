Kilograms per capita of waste disposed of by year are represented in a heat map divided by departments. For this heat map the largest amount of kilograms per capita disposed of is coloured in blue and the least in green. Year by year the amount of departments coloured in the map increases and the general overview is changing due to there are departments that are being included which can change the highest amount disposed of, however this does not mean that the departments are having a better management of their wastes.
