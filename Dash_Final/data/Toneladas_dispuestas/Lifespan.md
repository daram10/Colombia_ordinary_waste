Lifespan of 148 landfills around Colombia reported by Superintendencia is represented in a heat map divided into categories proposed by the group 207. This lifespan was calculated taking into account the total designed capacity in tons and subtracting the total tons disposed of up to date for each department, finally a percentage was calculated. The categories proposed are represented by green if the remaining capacity is higher than 70%, yellow if the remaining capacity is between 70 and 30% and red if the remaining capacity is lower than 30%. In general 89 % of the landfills present a good remaining capacity, 7% a m√©dium remaining capacity and 4% a low remaining capacity.
