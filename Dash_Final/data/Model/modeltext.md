**Model description:** we were interested in evaluating the relationship between the lifespans of sanitary landfills and the recovery rate of the municipalities in which they are located. We decided to implement k-means clustering to describe the landfills according to these two characteristics.
We found three main clusters. The first one describes sanitary landfills located in municipalities with low recovery rates and low lifespans (blue); the second one with sanitary landfills that have low recovery rates but medium lifespans (red); and finally sanitary landfills with medium recovery rates but low lifespans (green). 
Feel free to hover your pointer to find out where your sanitary landfill lands!
