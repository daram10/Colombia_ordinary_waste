An increase in the daily production of ordinary waste around the globe has become a concern on the political agenda in the majority of countries. According to the World Bank, “the world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, with at least 33 percent of that—extremely conservatively—not managed in an environmentally safe manner. Worldwide, waste generated per person per day averages 0.74 kilograms but ranges widely, from 0.11 to 4.54 kilograms”.
